Let's say you need to understand how the dashboard works in the application.

**With Amazon Q Developer:**

1. Open the DashboardController.php file
2. Type `@file` to include the current file in context
3. Ask: "Can you explain how this dashboard controller works and what data it's retrieving?"

Amazon Q will provide a detailed explanation of:
- How the controller fetches income and expense data
- The date range calculations for the current month
- How the data is organized for the dashboard view
- The relationship between the controller and its view

## 2. Adding New Features

Now that we understand the codebase, let's use Amazon Q Developer to help us add new features to our Personal Finance Manager.

### Scenario: Adding Budget Management Feature

Our users have requested a new feature to set monthly budgets for different expense categories. Let's implement this with Amazon Q's help.

**With Amazon Q Developer:**

1. Start a new conversation and type: "I want to add a budget management feature to the Personal Finance Manager application. Users should be able to set monthly budgets for each expense category and track their spending against these budgets."

2. Amazon Q will suggest an implementation approach:

```
To implement a budget management feature, we'll need to:

1. Create a new Budget model to store budget data
2. Add a BudgetController to handle budget operations
3. Create views for setting and viewing budgets
4. Update the dashboard to show budget progress

Let's start with the database structure and model.
```

3. Ask Amazon Q to generate the Budget model: "Can you create a Budget.php model file for the budget management feature?"

Amazon Q will generate a complete model file with appropriate methods for CRUD operations, validation, and relationships to other models.

**Best Practice:** Break down complex feature requests into smaller, more manageable tasks when working with Amazon Q. This helps the AI provide more focused and accurate assistance.

### Scenario: Enhancing the Dashboard with Budget Progress

Now, let's enhance the dashboard to display budget progress for each category.

**With Amazon Q Developer:**

1. Open the dashboard view file (views/dashboard/index.php)
2. Type `@file` to include the current file in context
3. Ask: "Can you help me add a section to display budget progress for each expense category on the dashboard?"

Amazon Q will generate the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create a budget progress section, including progress bars that visually represent spending against budgets.

**Lesson Learned:** When asking Amazon Q to modify existing files, always provide context about the current file structure and functionality. This helps the AI generate more accurate and compatible code.

## 3. Debugging and Troubleshooting

Even the best developers encounter bugs. Let's see how Amazon Q Developer can help us troubleshoot issues in our Personal Finance Manager application.

### Scenario: Fixing a Data Calculation Issue

Imagine users are reporting that the monthly balance calculation on the dashboard is incorrect.

**With Amazon Q Developer:**

1. Open the DashboardController.php file
2. Type `@file` to include the current file in context
3. Ask: "There seems to be an issue with the balance calculation on the dashboard. Can you help me identify potential problems in this code?"

Amazon Q will analyze the code and might identify issues like:

```
I notice a potential issue in the balance calculation. The code is calculating the balance as:

$balance = $totalIncome - $totalExpense;

However, there's no validation to ensure that $totalIncome and $totalExpense are numeric values. If either method returns null or a non-numeric value, this could cause incorrect calculations.

Let's add proper validation:

// Get total income for current month
$totalIncome = $this->incomeModel->getTotalIncomeByDateRange($userId, $startDate, $endDate);
$totalIncome = is_numeric($totalIncome) ? $totalIncome : 0;

// Get total expense for current month
$totalExpense = $this->expenseModel->getTotalExpenseByDateRange($userId, $startDate, $endDate);
$totalExpense = is_numeric($totalExpense) ? $totalExpense : 0;

// Get balance
$balance = $totalIncome - $totalExpense;
```

**Best Practice:** When debugging with Amazon Q, provide as much context as possible about the issue, including any error messages or unexpected behaviors you're observing.

## 4. Code Optimization and Best Practices

Amazon Q Developer can help us improve our code quality by suggesting optimizations and best practices.

### Scenario: Optimizing Database Queries

Let's optimize the database queries in our Income model to improve performance.

**With Amazon Q Developer:**

1. Open the Income.php model file
2. Type `@file` to include the current file in context
3. Ask: "Can you suggest ways to optimize the database queries in this model for better performance?"

Amazon Q might suggest improvements like:

```
Here are some optimizations for the database queries in the Income model:

1. Add indexing to frequently queried columns:
   - income_date
   - user_id
   - category_id

2. Use prepared statements consistently for all queries to improve security and performance

3. Implement query caching for frequently accessed data like monthly totals

4. Batch related queries where possible instead of making multiple database calls

5. Consider pagination for large result sets to reduce memory usage and improve response time
```
